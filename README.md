# CodingProblems
- Alignment uses [Needleman-Wunsch](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Needleman%E2%80%93Wunsch_algorithm) and [Smith-Waterman](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Smith%E2%80%93Waterman_algorithm) algorithms to perform alignment of genetic sequences.
- MedianSortedArray finds the median of two sorted arrays with O(log (m+n)) time complexity.
- PerfectSquare uses Newton's method to evaluate whether an integer is a perfect square, inspired by [this paper](https://math.mit.edu/~stevenj/18.335/newton-sqrt.pdf).
